# Movie-Trailer-Website
Movie-Trailer_Website is a the first project in Udacity's [Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree] (https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).
The three provided Python files work together to create a website displaying my favorite movies, with links to their trailers.

## Python Files
### - entertainment_center.py 
Entertainment_center.py is used to create movies (using media.py), as well as to add movies to the website and launch the page 
(using fresh_tomatoes.py)
### - media.py
Media.py creates a movie object containing title, plot, poster image, and a link to the youtube trailer
### - fresh_tomatoes.py
Fresh_tomatoes.py was proveded by Udacity to facilitiate the design of the website using bootstrap, 
and the launching of the website using open_movies_page(). I added onto this code to add some additional functionality.

## Requirements
In order to run this on your own computer you will need to have Python installed. Once you have done that, 
make sure all three files are saved in the same directory, and then open entertainment_center.py. Your webpage should open in the brower.
